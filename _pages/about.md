I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University, under the supervision of [Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/eric-d-kolaczyk). I completed my PhD in Statistics in the Department of Statistics and Operational Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, co-advised by [Shankar Bhamidi](https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/) and [Yufeng Liu](https://yfliu.web.unc.edu/). Prior to the graduate school, I received my B.S. in Statistics at Shanahai Universitv of Finance and Economics in 2018. 

My research interests include network analysis, statistical machine learning, high-dimensional data, clustering, and dimension reduction.
